## 📚 What You’ll Be Learning

We’ll walk step-by-step through the core areas of modern web technologies — from simple web pages to cross-platform apps. Here's the roadmap:

---

### 1. 🧱 **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** — Your Foundation

These three are the backbone of everything you see on the web.

- **HTML** (HyperText Markup Language): the structure
- **CSS** (Cascading Style Sheets): the design
- **JavaScript**: the interactivity

📁 Explore: `core-web/`

> Build simple pages, play with styles, and bring your first scripts to life.

---

### 2. ⚛️ **React** — Dynamic Single Page Applications (SPA)

React helps you create smooth, modern web apps using reusable components and state management.  
With React, you’ll learn to:

- Break a UI into components
- Handle data and user input
- Navigate pages without reloads

📁 Explore: `react-spa/`

> Your first real web app starts here.

---

### 3. 📱 **React Native** — One Codebase, Two Platforms

React Native lets you write once and deploy to both Android and iOS.  
With this skill, you’ll be able to:

- Design native mobile UIs
- Navigate between mobile screens
- Use mobile device features

📁 Explore: `react-native-app/`

> Time to build your first mobile app — the cross-platform way.
