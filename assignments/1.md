# 📘 Assignment: Add Numbers from 1 to 10 in JavaScript

## 🧠 Goal

Write a small JavaScript program that adds all the numbers from **1 to 10**, and displays the result in the browser.

---

## ✅ What You Need to Do

1. Create a new file called `add-numbers.html` in the `core-web/` folder.
2. Inside the file, write basic HTML structure (`<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<body>`, etc.).
3. Use a `<script>` tag to write your JavaScript code.
4. Your code should:
   - Add all numbers from 1 to 10.
   - Display the result somewhere in the browser — it's your choice how you do this. You can print it directly, insert it into an element, or explore another creative way.
5. Open the file in your browser and check if the result appears correctly.
