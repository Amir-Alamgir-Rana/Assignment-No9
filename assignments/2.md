# 📘 Assignment #2: Interactive Sum with an HTML Form

## 🎯 Goal

Create a web page that allows the user to enter a number using an HTML form, then calculates and displays the sum from 1 to that number using the formula:

\[
\text{Sum} = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
\]

---

## ✅ Instructions

1. Create a new folder called:

assignment2

2. Inside that folder, create **three files**:

- `index.html`
- `style.css`
- `script.js`

3. Your webpage should:

- Contain a clean HTML form with:
  - An input field for the number
  - A button labeled **“Calculate Sum”**
- When the user clicks the button:
  - Read the input
  - Compute the sum using the formula above
  - Display the result directly on the page

## 📁 Folder Layout

```
assignment2/
├── index.html
├── style.css
└── script.js
```

---

## 💡 Hints

- Make sure the page doesn’t reload when the button is clicked
- You can use `event.preventDefault()` in JavaScript
- Style it nicely — continue the premium look from Assignment #1

---

## ✨ Bonus Ideas (Optional)

- Add input validation (e.g. no negatives or letters)
- Animate the result when it appears
- Use gold gradients or glowing buttons to match the rich UI theme

---

## 📝 Submission

Once completed, commit and push the folder:

```bash
git add assignment2
git commit -m "Assignment 2: Interactive Sum with HTML form"
git push origin main
```

## 🚫 Reminder

👉 **Do not create a `solution2` folder**. The **solution will be provided separately later**.
Only your `assignment2` folder should be uploaded.
