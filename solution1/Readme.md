# 💼 Sum Calculator – Elegant Formula Edition

Hi Amir! 👋  
This is your first self-contained HTML/CSS/JS project — a **sum calculator** that looks like it was made by a luxury fintech startup 💸✨

---

## 📁 Folder Structure

You're currently inside:

C:\vscode\amir\solution1

```

Here's what’s inside:

```

solution1/
├── index.html ← The main webpage
├── style.css ← Elegant styling (rich vibes)
└── script.js ← JavaScript for sum calculation

```

---

## 🧮 What This Does

- Prompts you to enter any positive number
- Instantly calculates the **sum from 1 to that number** using this formula:

\[
\text{Sum} = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
\]

- Displays the result beautifully in the browser 🧠

---

## 🚀 How to Run It

### ✅ Option 1: Double-click
Just double-click `index.html` — it’ll open in your default browser.

### ✅ Option 2: Run through VSCode (Recommended)
1. Open the folder in VSCode:
```

File > Open Folder > C:\vscode\amir\solution1

````

2. Right-click `index.html` in the explorer sidebar
3. Click **“Open with Live Server”** (if you have the extension)

---

## 🎨 Want to Customize?

- Try changing the number range or formula logic in `script.js`
- Play with golds, shadows, or fonts in `style.css`
- Add your name, logo, or branding in `index.html`

This is your canvas — go bold 🖌️

## 💾 Reminder: Save & Version Your Work

## ✨ Final Thought

- Clean structure

- And design taste that _slaps_

Keep going, Amir! This is just the beginning 🔥👑
